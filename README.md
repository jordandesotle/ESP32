# ESP32

This repo consists of four files:
- sender.ino
- receiver.ino
- sniffer_final.ino
- spoofer_final.ino

# Usage

These scripts were written for ESP32 devices in order to replicate esp-now traffic.
By sending and receiving traffic between two known points using the sender.ino and receiver.ino files,
it is possible to sniff and spoof that data using a third ESP32 device.

I used the Arduino IDE to upload and program the devices.
